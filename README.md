An electrical appliances control toolkit write by C （server which run in）.
I used it to control three lights and one electric fan in my domistory.The auto identification module was not complete which work depends on the IP address of wifi.
It depends on the wiringPi project of raspberry so that if you want to compile it you must install the wiringPi in your raspberry.
